# CWL 

CWL workflows for generating GRAY (2013,2017) and UHNBreast (2017,2019) PharmacoSets(PSets) using the *PharmacoGx* toolset.
<br/>
<br/>
To execute a workflow, perform the following command within the workflow directory of a respective dataset (example for GRAY 2017 dataset):
<br/>
<br/>
`cwltool getGRAY2017_Workflow.cwl getGRAY2017_Workflow.yml`


**NOTE**: Methylation data for GRAY 2013 and 2017 are compressed for uploading to GitHub. Therefore, please unzip the raw data file before execution.
